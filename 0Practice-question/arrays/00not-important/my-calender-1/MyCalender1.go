/*
729 You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.


Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]

Explanation
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
*/

package main

type MyCalendar struct {
	times [][2]int
}

func Constructor() MyCalendar {
	return MyCalendar{[][2]int{}}
}

func (this *MyCalendar) Book(start int, end int) bool {
	for _, pair := range this.times {
		if start < pair[1] && end > pair[0] {
			return false
		}
	}
	this.times = append(this.times, [2]int{start, end})

	return true
}
